# BuildQuest
This is a rogue-lite game where you control a wild wizard who needs to survive passage through the dungeon to win. A new dungeon pathway is generated every play-through. It's a Unity WebGL build, so you can play it in your browser.

Controls: WASD is for movement. Holding down your left mouse button charges up your attack, making it more powerful. Careful! If you charge up too much, you explode!

All sprites were created using Crypixels and GIMP. The game is live on IPFS with help from Pinata. Unfortunately, I could not deploy custom smart contracts to allow users to own character NFTs and store their scores in metadata.
